# Java Assessment Challenges

This project provides a package basic to low level intermediate coding tests for use in talent acquisition and skill validation.

The aim is for this project to be zipped up and provided to a trainee or talent assessed graduate. The zipped package will need to be supplied alongside the java introduction to coding guide (at the time of writing this README - 12/02/18 this is in planning).
